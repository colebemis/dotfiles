# dotfiles

This repo contains my personal dotfiles. Inspired by [Managing Your Dotfiles](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/).

## Installation

```shell
# Clone the repository (including submodules) into ~/.dotfiles directory
git clone --recursive https://github.com/colebemis/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# Enter the ~/.dotfiles directory
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Run the install script
./install
```

> **Note:** The install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.
